## Brief
  In this project, I am making api calls to SpaceX data directory to fetch details of missions depending
  upon filters like `launch year`, `launch success`, `landing success`.
  
## Working
  In default case(without filtering), all the data is fetched to a limit of 100.
  If launch_year is selected, the data pertaining to that particular date, limit to 100 is fetched.
  If launch_success(true/false) is selected, then data with selected filter is fetched, limit to 100.
  Similar happens when land_success is selected.
  `However there could be different cases of combined filtering that can be appplied, apart from the ones mentioned above`.
  
  
 ## Tech Stack and Packages
 
 `React`
 `axios for fetching data`
 
 use `npm start` to start the app.
